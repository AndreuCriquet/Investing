Notice that this porgram makes you insert, for each company:

- Expected next 5 years yearly average growth in % 
- Expected later 5 years (5 to 10) yearly average growth in %
- Expected investment return in % (Actually discount rate, but "investment return" should be more understandable)
- Expected terminal multiple (e.g. Cash flow per share ratio)
- Amount of shares in millions (used to divde calculated intrinsic value and obtain recommended share price).
